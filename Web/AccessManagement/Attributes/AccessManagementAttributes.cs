/// The <see cref="AuthorizeControllerAttribute"/> is used at the controller level to enforce a set of permissions across all action methods within the controller. 
/// This ensures that only users with the appropriate permissions can interact with the controller's endpoints. Permissions are defined as strings and can 
/// represent specific actions, resources, or roles within the system. When combined with a permissions prefix, this attribute allows for a structured and 
/// scalable approach to defining access control policies within an ASP.NET Core application.
